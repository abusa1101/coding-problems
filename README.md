# coding-problems

1. My solutions to a collection of coding problems (utilizing important programming concepts/techniques) in C and Python.
2. Tutorial to Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM) and a simple LCM coding problem. In this problem, LCM is used to subscribe to a channel and also publish to that same channel, to get a simple idea of how LCM works.
